### {{ site.iteration }} RECOMB Satellite Conference on Hardware Acceleration of Bioinformatics Workloads 

{{ site.title }} is the {{ site.iteration }} edition of a series of algorithmic computational biology conferences bridging the areas of computational, mathematical, statistical and biological sciences, focusing on the co-design of hardware and software and the use of new computer architectures, including compiler optimizations, APIs, and DSLs that support acceleration platforms. The conference features keynote talks by preeminent scientists in life sciences, presentations of ground breaking research in in the bioinformatics, computational biology, and computer architecture communities to strengthen the progress in accelerating bioinformatics analysis (e.g., genome, transcriptome, proteome analysis) with efficient system designs that include hardware acceleration and software systems tailored for new hardware technologies.
